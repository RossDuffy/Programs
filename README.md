Programming work by Ross Duffy

Projects:

                Vending Machine:
                - As part of an assignment myself and a small group programmed a basic
                simulation of a vending machine. I was responsible for creating the
                command line interface as well as the functions it needed to operate.
                - This project allowed me to develop my object oriented Java
                programming experience.
                - Working as a group on this project benefited my teamwork and
                communication skills.

                A* search algorithm for 8 and 15 puzzle:
                - I wrote the functions to calculate the heuristic values in order to
                allow an algorithm to solve an 8-puzzle or a 15-puzzle.
                - This project furthered my Java programming experience.
                -  Working as a group in this project helped me to develop my
                communication and teamwork skills.

                Grocery Shop SQL database project:
                - I programmed a small database based on a grocery shop as part of a
                small group. I was responsible for writing the Views, Functions,
                Procedures, and some of the Triggers that formed the database.
                - This project greatly advanced my SQL experience allowing me to learn
                how to implement triggers, views, functions, and procedures into a
                database.
                - This project advanced my teamwork and communication skills. It
                                                           Student code    17201624
                developed my research skills as I had to research how to effectively
                implement my components into the database. It furthered my
                presentation skills as I had to work on presenting the data
                effectively to a user.

                Test driven development project:
                - As part of a group I built a program using test driven development
                to the specifications of our assignment which involved creating a
                program and test cases in order to test it using JUnit.
                - With this project I learned and developed my ability to construct
                JUnit tests and use them to improve my program.
                - This project furthered my teamwork and communication skills. It
                developed my research skills as I had to research how to implement the
                tests effectively.
